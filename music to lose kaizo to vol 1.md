<p align="center"><i>A collection of battle themes for my Kaizo Ironmon attempts.</i>

This album features songs composed for various key moments in my Kaizo Ironmon runs. Each track is designed to match the intensity, frustration, and fleeting hope of battling Gym Leaders, the Elite Four, and the Championâ€”where every move could be your last.

Whether you're sweeping a gym, getting frozen solid by Lorelei, or watching your best run end to a surprise Destiny Bond, there's a song here for that moment.</p>
